## Description
The project fits inside the second category as a useful app. We decided to utilize the QTCreator software to test the knowledge gained from UC Merced's CSE165 course. To successfully create a graphing calculator app we fulfilled the requirements as follows:
Requirements
- User must be able to input data via a graphical user interface
    - The user is able to input mathematical operations to either with or without a graph plot
- Data must be processed with one or more algorithms
    - The output shown on the graph plot was processed with an algorithm to parse user input text into mathematical functions
 - Data must be output in a useful format
    - The output on the graphing calculator is useful for providing a visual aid for polynomial graphs either linear or up to any Degree.

## How to use
Examples of equations: “y = x^2+56”, “y = 4x^3+5x-2”, “y = 4, x^2-5”, “-2x^2+5”
Limitations: all numbers must be a whole number, exponents must be positive.
